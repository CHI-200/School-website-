This is a multi-page website for a university with pages like Home, About, Courses, Blog, and Contact. It has responsive design, dark mode, and can be run in any devices
The index, course, contact, blog files has the same navigation, toggle and footer. The CSS and JavaScript are linked, using external libraries like Font Awesome and Google Fonts.
The index.html file is the main page which contains different sections for the header, courses, campus, facilities, testimonials, a call to action, and a footer. I also added a dark mode toggle and responsive navigation.
The course.html focuses on courses and facilities. it has a different header section.
The about.html file has two flex column layouts, one for text and the other for an image.
The contact.html file include a contact form, a map embed and contact information.
The style.css file contains all the styling for the different HTML pages, including dark mode toggling. I used flexbox, media queris for responsiveness and grid for layouts
